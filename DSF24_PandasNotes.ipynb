    "## What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a newer package built on top of NumPy, and provides an efficient implementation of a `DataFrame`. `DataFrames` are essentially multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels that can handle multiple data types and/or missing data. Pandas also defines `Series` which represents observations of a single variable. Not only is Pandas is a convenient medium for storing labeled data, it implements many powerful operations from database managers and spreadsheet programs.\n",
    " \n",
    "Pandas was created to offer more versatile data structures that are straightforward to use for storing, manipulating and analyzing heterogeneous data:\n",
    "1. Data is clearly organized in *variables* and *observations*\n",
    "2. Each variable is permitted to have a different data type.\n",
    "3. We can use *labels* to select observations, instead of having to use a linear numerical index as with NumPy. We could, for example, index a data set using National Insurance Numbers.\n",
    "4. Pandas offers many convenient data aggregation and reduction routines that can be applied to subsets of data. For example, we can easily group observations by city and compute average incomes.\n",
    "5. Pandas also offers many convenient data import / export functions that go beyond what’s in NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then shouldn't we be using pandas at all times, then? No!\n",
    "- For low-level tasks where performance is essential, use NumPy.\n",
    "- For homogenous data without any particular data structure, use NumPy.\n",
    "- On the other hand, if data is heterogeneous, needs to be imported from an external data source and cleaned or transformed before performing computations, use pandas. "

    "Pandas has two main data structures:\n",
    "1. `Series` represents observations of a single variable.\n",
    "2. `DataFrame` is a container for several variables. You can think of each individual column of a `DataFrame` as a `Series`, and each row represents one observation.\n",

    "## Setting the DataFrame\n",
    "When making a line graph, you want your `DataFrame` to have the x-axis values as the column index and the data points in their own column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted to plot personal savings over time, our `DataFrame` could look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  index   | Savings |\n",
    "| -------- | ------- |\n",

    "| February | $80     |\n",
    "| March    | $420    |\n",
    "\n",
    "The months, which will become our x-axis, are the indices and the data we want to plot is in its own column, `Savings`. If we wanted to plot our spending on the same line graph, we would add another column to our `DataFrame` and fill in our spending for each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your `DataFrame` is flipped, you can use `df.T` to *transpose* the `DataFrame`. This function will switch the indices and the columns of the `DataFrame` and move all the data as appropriate.\n",

    "\n",
    "We could make it match our target `DataFrame` above using `df.T`. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You can run this function multiple times to add multiple lines to the same graph. Your final plot will not appear until you run `plt.show()`. \n",
